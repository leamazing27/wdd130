        <p>Hi! I'm Lea and I am from Philippines. I love hiking. I've been a member of the church since 1990. Been looking around social media the missionaries who taught us the gospel but no luck, one is a fellow Filipino the other one is from West Valley City Utah, I am  just forever grateful to them for bringing the gospel to our family. Back then, they would walk 6km 2-way for their appointment with us, precious memories. It's my first time in programming world, I'm so excited to learn a lot from this course!! </p>
